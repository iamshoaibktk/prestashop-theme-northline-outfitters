## What you get

- **Child theme of Hummingbird** (`parent: hummingbird`). No parent templates are copied, so Hummingbird and PrestaShop updates keep working.
- **Hummingbird Theme Kit module** (`hbkit` v1.1.0): colours, fonts, corners, header and footer style as CSS variables, a top bar, and a homepage builder (banners, faq, hero, image text, products, testimonials).
- **Page layouts you can switch in the back office**: side cart, cart page, category pages, product page and product cards, each with several picture-chosen styles. This demo uses: small add-to-cart notice; classic cart page; filters in the left column; category title on a banner image; classic product page; details in an accordion; 4 products per row; label product cards.
- **One-click demo import**: 24 products with sizes/colours and features, 6 categories, brands, 8 CMS pages, main menu, footer links, reassurance blocks and 6 homepage sections.
- **10 languages** for everything: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, German, Czech, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian.
- Self-hosted fonts (SIL Open Font License), no external font or tracking calls.
